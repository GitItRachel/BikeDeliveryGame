# BikeDeliveryGame
Bike delivery game for OSU Hackathon

This game was developed using the Unity engine and MapBox SDK for Unity. The game allows users to view bike "delivery" routes in their area and track the start and
stop of a delivery when in range of the markers.  There are currently only a few start and stop delivery locations built out in the Chicago area.
You can add additional start and stop delivery points by editing the list in the map and gamedata game objects.
